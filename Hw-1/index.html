            <p>
            I am currently working on my bachelors of media arts and have recieved associates degrees in fine arts and art history.  While my background is in the fine arts with a focus on portriat painting, I have fallen in love with media arts over the last few years.  I hope to complete my degree by the end of this year.  I have also recently started to do design and logo work for the owner of the company that I am working for.

               Outside of art, I am a huge fan of the outdoors.  It was a major part of my decision to move to Montana from California.  I find the landscapes and views here to be incredibly powerful and inspiring, and love being outdoors whenever I can.
