# Hw-1
I used the basic struture of a parallax website that I made last spring for this assignment and modified it to fit this assignment. 
I took out many pieces of code that were unnessecary, changed the image links, headers and text and changed the background colors.  I also 
added a link to take you from the beginning of the page to the "about me" section.  
I had a bit of trouble getting back into the swing of things for thiss assignment, and ran into several issues.


-For starters, I read the due date incorrectly and for some reason thought this was due at midnight which resulted in me turning it in late.
I will have to work on reading things more carefully.  
-Linking images wasn't working for me, until I realized that the first part of the link tag was incorrect.  Once I fixed this everything worked
smoothly.

Generally, I think that since it has been a semester since I did any HTML work I will need to brush up on the basics in the next few weeks 
but am looking forward to it!
