# Week 2 README

This weeks lesson was pretty easy but interesting.  The Hello World! exercise was a pretty effective way of experimenting with Java script 
and testing it out.  I didn't really have any problems with the material or homework this week.  The only thing that I struggled with was 
that I use the "live view" split screen feature of Dream Weaver, which gives a preview of the output of your code in real time.  I 
think that this is an extremely useful tool and rely on it alot.  However the java script wasn't effecting the live view for some reason 
inside of Dream Weaver so i thought that it wasn't working at first.  That was my only problem this week which was good.  I used the extra 
time to re-read a few chapters in Duckett and look at some other resources to brush up on my HTML skills.
