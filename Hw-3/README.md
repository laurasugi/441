This week's work with Java Script was very challenging and frusturating for me, but I am looking forward to conquering Javascript (Or at 
least understanding it a bit more). I had a few technical difficulties that added to this, including the Eloquent JavaScript webpage freezing my computer everytime I attempted to use the code practice examples.  Also my GitHub Desktop glitched out this week and wouldn't 
allow me to commit anything.  Luckily I remembered you can manually upload and edit code right on github so I will just have to clone my repo once GitHub support gets back to me and I get my desktop app fixed. 

Other than that I had a pretty difficult time with the material this week, especially the third question.  I was able to make my program work correctly for the most part, but for all the numbers that were divisible by both 3 and 5 my program is printing out "Fizz", 'Buzz" and "Fizzbuzz".  I wasn't able to figure out how to get it to output only "Fizzbuzz".
