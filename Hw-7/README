#H1 HW-7 README


  Throughout the course of this project and class, I learned quite a bit.  Primarily, that javascript is not "my thing".  I had an
  incredibly difficult time with it and struggled almost every step of the way on this project.  However, successfully completing
  this project was a very rewarding feeling and I feel like my skills have absolutely improved. While I don't see myself becoming a
  full-stack or back end developer any time, I did learn many things that I can use to enhance my front-end work with HTML and CSS.
  I think that a basic understanding of what is possible with JavaScript and the ability to utilize it for more concise solutions to design
  issues will be a huge benefit to me in my work after graduation.  
 
 
I am primarily a visual artist with my works usually being static in nature, and this was a great opportunity to
  experiment with a different type of story-telling than I am used to.  I feel like this project was a great culmination of the skills that I
  have learned in the media arts program, combining visual design, sound design, mark-up languages and programing to create the user
  experience.  The idea came partially from personal experiences and partially from the true crime stories that I grew up surrounded by.  
  I grew up in an area with one of the highest unsolved murder rates in the United States, and always was fascinated by people's 
  simultaneous interest with these cases and their inability to talk openly about it.  The question of how victims are perceived by the 
  media and police, and how that affects who gets justice in these cases is also something I wanted to explore in this project.  I didnâ€™t 
  get to delve as deep into that aspect as I wanted to, but that was what motivated me to chose the different outcomes.  Due to the 
  limits of my coding skills in JS, I wasn't able to push this project quite as far as I wanted to artistically but overall I am
  very satisfied with it.
